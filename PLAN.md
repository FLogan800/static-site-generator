# Static Site Generator Plan

## What is the Project?

This project is a static site generator written in Rust

## MVP

- [ ] Take directory to a markdown file
- [ ] Parse single line elements (headers, lists, etc...)
- [ ] Parse multi line elements (bold, italic, etc...)
- [ ] Parse links/images using regex
- [ ] Basic markdown syntax

## Nice to Have

- [ ] Extended markdown syntax
- [ ] Parsing an entire directory rather than one folder

## When will it be Complete?

Due to finals, needing to study, work, etc... I expect the MVP to be finished by 12/20/2024
